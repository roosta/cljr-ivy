# clj-refactor-ivy

A Ivy wrapper for the cljr features.

This is a fork of
[cljr-helm](https://github.com/philjackson/cljr-helm).  Props goes to
that repo, I just adapted it to ivy.

Remembering key bindings for cljr is hard, especially the less
frequently used ones - this should help with that.

## Usage

Add `(require 'cljr-ivy)` to your init file, bind `cljr-ivy` to a key
(I'd suggest `C-c C-r`) in Clojure mode, and you're ready to go.
